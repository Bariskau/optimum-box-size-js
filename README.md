# Calculating the size of a box for multiple products

Boxes of different sizes may need to be put in one box. If you only have one product to box, the size of the box is obvious. But what happens when you need to box more than one product? The project calculates all the box combinations that the multiple box can fit in.

## Important note

#### Can I just use the algorithm?

The calculation algorithm is in **/scripts/volume-calculator.js**. You can use it directly.

#### Can I use frontend codes?

Yes, but the improvements were made **quickly** and for **demo purposes** only. For this reason, you may encounter bugs and errors in use.
